      I have been working as a <span style="color:#10B981; font-weight: 700;">Pre sales engineer </span> for a specific cybersolution in a big regional company for 6 years. A few months ago, the company decided  open a new vacancy for other pre sales engineer, but this time for a different cybersolution. I was very interested in this new position, so I applied for it.         
    </p>
    
    <p>
      First, I had to take a test to see if I had the right skills for the job. The test was very difficult, but I managed to pass it. After that, I had a final interview with the manager and the HR department. They asked me a lot of questions about my experience and my skills, and I think I did well.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span style="color:#e67e22; font-weight: 100;">unfortunately</span>, I didn't get the job. The manager told me that they had decided to hire someone else who had more experience in the specific cybersolution. I was very disappointed, but I understood their decision. I know that I have a lot to learn and that I need to improve my skills if I want to be successful in this field.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe If I had more experience in the specific cybersolution, I would have been a better candidate for the job. But now I have more knowledge because the preparation learned me a lot things that I didn't know before.
