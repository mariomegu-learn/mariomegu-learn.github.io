    <h1>Three things that I regret <span class="emojis">üòî</span></h1>
    <p>
      Hello everyone, today I want to share with you <span style="color:#10B981; font-weight: 700;">3 things that I regret in my life</span>. I hope you can learn from my mistakes and avoid making the same ones.
    </p>
    <p> 
        I think it's important to reflect on our past and learn from it. Regrets can be painful, but they can also be valuable lessons that help us grow and become better people. So, here are my three biggest regrets:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Not taking more risks in my career. I played it safe for too long and missed out on some great opportunities.  If I had taken more risks, I might have achieved greater success and personal growth.</li>
            <li>Not traveling more when I was younger. I always wanted to see the world, but I never made it a priority. If I had traveled more in my youth, I would have experienced so many amazing cultures and places.</li>
            <li>Not spending enough time with my family. I was always so focused on my career and other commitments that I didn't make enough time for the people who matter most to me. If I had spent more time with my family, I would have created more beautiful memories with them.</li>
            <li>
                <b style="color:#e67e22; font-weight: 700;">Plus</b>: If I had started learning English earlier, I would have been able to communicate with more people and open up more opportunities for myself.
            </li>
        </ol>
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Today I'm 38 years old, but I think it's never too late to start. <span class="emojis">‚ò∫Ô∏è</span>
